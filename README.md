## Why Use LineaPy?

Going from development to production is full of friction. Data engineering is a manual and
time-consuming process. A proliferation of libraries, tools, and technologies means data teams
spend countless hours managing infrastructure and repeating tasks. This drastically reduces
the teamâ€™s ability to deliver actionable insights in real-time.

LineaPy creates a frictionless path for taking your data science work from development to production,
backed by a decade of research and industry expertise tackling hyperscale data challenges.

***Data engineering, simplified.***
> Your data science artifact works, now comes the cleanup.
LineaPy extracts essential operations from the messy development code in minutes not days,
simplifying data engineering with just two lines of code.

***You analyze, we productionize.***
> Productionization is manual, messy, and it requires
software engineering expertise to create clean, reproducible code. LineaPy automatically handles
lineage and refactoring so you can focus on experimenting, analyzing, and modeling.

***Move fast from prototype to pipeline.***
> LineaPy automates code translations to save you time
and help you stay focused. Rapidly create analytics pipelines with a simple API &mdash; no refactoring
or new tools needed. Go from your Jupyter notebook to an Airflow pipeline in minutes.

## Getting Started

### Installation

To install LineaPy, run:

```bash
pip install lineapy
```

Or, if you want the latest version of LineaPy directly from the source, run:

```
pip install git+https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy.git --upgrade
```

LineaPy offers several extras to extend its core capabilities:

| Version  | Installation Command            | Enables                                                  |
|----------|---------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| minimal  | `pip install lineapy[minimal]`  | Minimal dependencies for LineaPy                         |
| dev      | `pip install lineapy[dev]`      | All LineaPy dependencies for testing and development     |
| graph    | `pip install lineapy[graph]`    | Dependencies to visualize LineaPy node graph             |
| postgres | `pip install lineapy[postgres]` | Dependencies to use PostgreSQL backend                   |

The `minimal` version of LineaPy does not include `black` or `isort`,
which may result in less organized output code and scripts.

By default, LineaPy uses SQLite for artifact store, which keeps the package light and simple.
However, SQLite has several limitations, one of which is that it does not support multiple concurrent
writes to a database (it will result in a database lock). If you want to use a more robust database,
please follow [instructions](https://docs.lineapy.org/en/latest/guide/manage_artifacts/database/postgres.html) for using PostgreSQL.

### Interfaces

#### Jupyter and IPython

To use LineaPy in an interactive computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab or IPython, launch the environment with the `lineapy` command, like so:

```bash
lineapy jupyter notebook
```

```bash
lineapy jupyter lab
```

```bash
lineapy ipython
```

This will automatically load the LineaPy extension in the corresponding interactive shell application.

Or, if the application is already running without the extension loaded, which can happen
when we start the Jupyter server with `jupyter notebook` or `jupyter lab` without `lineapy`,
you can load it on the fly with:

```python
%load_ext lineapy
```

executed at the top of your session. Please note:

- You will need to run this as the first command in a given session; executing it
in the middle of a session will lead to erroneous behaviors by LineaPy.

- This loads the extension to the current session only, i.e., it does not carry over
to different sessions; you will need to repeat it for each new session.

#### Hosted Jupyter Environment

In hosted Jupyter notebook environments such as JupyterHub, Google Colab, Kaggle or other environments that you do not start your notebook from CLI (such as Jupyter extension within VS Code), you need to install `lineapy` directly within your notebook first via:

```ipython
!pip install lineapy
```

then you can manually load `lineapy` extension with :

```python
%load_ext lineapy
```

For environments with older versions `IPython<7.0` like Google Colab, we need to upgrade the `IPython>=7.0` module before the above steps, we can upgrade `IPython` via:

```ipython
!pip install --upgrade ipython
```

and restart the notebook runtime:

```ipython
exit()
```

then we can start setting up LineaPy as described previously.

#### CLI

We can also use LineaPy as a CLI command. Run:

```bash
lineapy python --help
```

to see available options.

### Quick Start

Once you have LineaPy installed, you are ready to start using the package. We can start with a simple
example that demonstrates how to use LineaPy to store a variable's history. The `lineapy.save()` function
removes extraneous code to give you the simplest version of a variable's history.

Say we have development code looking as follows:

```python
import lineapy

# Define text to display in page heading
text = "Greetings"

# Some irrelevant operation
num = 1 + 2

# Change heading text
text = "Hello"

# Another irrelevant operation
num_squared = num**2

# Augment heading text
text = text + " World!"

# Try an alternative display
alt_text = text.split()
```

Now, we have reached the end of our development session and decided that we like
what we see when we `print(text)`. As shown above, `text` has gone through different
modifications, and it might not be clear how it reached its final state especially given other
extraneous operations between these modifications. We can cut through this by running:

```python
# Store the variable's history or "lineage"
lineapy.save(text, "text_for_heading")

# Retrieve the stored "artifact"
artifact = lineapy.get("text_for_heading")

# Obtain the simplest version of a variable's history
print(artifact.get_code())
```

which will print:

```
text = "Hello"
text = text + " World!"
```

Note that these are the minimal essential steps to get to the final state of the variable `text`.
That is, LineaPy has performed code cleanup on our behalf, moving us a step closer to production.

## Usage Reporting

LineaPy collects anonymous usage data that helps our team to improve the product.
Only LineaPy's API calls and CLI commands are being reported.
We strip out as much potentially sensitive information as possible, and we will
never collect user code, data, variable names, or stack traces.

You can opt-out of usage tracking by setting environment variable:

```bash
export LINEAPY_DO_NOT_TRACK=true
```
