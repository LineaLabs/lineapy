## What Problems Can LineaPy Solve?

### Use Case 1: Cleaning Messy Notebooks

When working in a Jupyter notebook day-to-day, it is easy to write messy code by
jumping around between cells, deleting cells, editing cells, and executing the same cell multiple times
&mdash; until we think we have some good results (e.g., tables, models, charts).
With this highly dynamic and interactive nature of notebook use, some issues may arise. For instance,
our colleagues who try to rerun the notebook may not be able to reproduce our results. Worse, with time passing,
we ourselves may have forgotten the exact steps to produce the previous results, hence unable to help our
colleagues.

One way to deal with this problem is to keep the notebook in sequential operations by constantly re-executing
the entire notebook during development. However, we soon realize that this interrupts our natural workflows and stream of
thoughts, decreasing our productivity. Therefore, it is much more common to clean up the notebook after development. This is a very time-consuming process and is not immune from reproducibility issues caused by deleting cells and out-of-order cell executions.

### Use Case 2: Revisiting Previous Work

Data science is often a team effort where one person's work uses results from another's. For instance,
a data scientist building a model may use various features engineered by other colleagues.
In using results generated by other people, we may encounter issues such as missing values, numbers that
look suspicious, and unintelligible variable names. If so, we may need to check how
these results came into being in the first place. Often, this means tracing back the code that was used
to generate the result in question (e.g., feature table). In practice, this can become a challenging task
because it may not be clear who produced the result. Even if we knew who to ask, the person might not remember
where the exact version of the code is. Worse, the person may have overwritten the code without version control.
Or, the person may no longer be in the organization with no proper handover of the relevant knowledge.
In any of these cases, it becomes extremely difficult to identify the root of the issue, which may render the result
unreliable and even unusable.

### Use Case 3: Building Pipelines

As our notebooks become more mature, they may get used like pipelines. For instance, our notebook might process the
latest data to update dashboards. Or, it may pre-process data and dump it to the filesystem for downstream model development.
Since other people rely on up-to-date results from our work, we might be expected to re-execute these processes on a regular basis.
Running a notebook is a manual, brittle process prone to errors, so we may want to set up proper pipelines for production.
Relevant engineering support may not be available, so we may need to clean up and refactor the notebook code so it can be used in
orchestration systems or job schedulers (e.g., cron, Apache Airflow, Prefect). Of course, this is assuming that we already know
what they are and how to work with them. If not, we need to spend time learning about them in the first place.
All this operational work involves time-consuming, manual labor, which means less time for us to spend on our core duties as a data scientist.

## Getting Started

LineaPy is a Python package for capturing, analyzing, and automating data science workflows.
At a high level, LineaPy traces the sequence of code execution to form a comprehensive understanding
of the code and its context. This understanding allows LineaPy to provide a set of tools that help
data scientists bring their work to production more quickly and easily, with just *two lines* of code.

Check this [section](#what-problems-can-lineapy-solve) for types of problems that LineaPy can help to solve.

### Prerequisites

LineaPy runs on `Python>=3.7` and `IPython>=7.0.0`. It does not come with a Jupyter installation,
so you will need to [install one](https://jupyter.org/install) for interactive computing.

### Installation

To install LineaPy, run:

```bash
pip install lineapy
```

If you want to run the latest version of LineaPy directly from the source, follow instructions
[here](https://docs.lineapy.org/en/latest/development/start/setup.html#installation).

LineaPy offers several extras to extend its core capabilities, such as support for PostgreSQL or Amazon S3.
Learn more about these and other installation options [here](https://docs.lineapy.org/en/latest/fundamentals/setup.html#extras).

### Interfaces

#### Jupyter and IPython

To use LineaPy in an interactive computing environment such as Jupyter Notebook/Lab or IPython, load its extension with:

```python
%load_ext lineapy
```

executed at the top of your session. Please note:

- You will need to run this as the first command in a given session; executing it
in the middle of a session will lead to erroneous behaviors by LineaPy.

- This loads the extension to the current session only, i.e., it does not carry over
to different sessions; you will need to repeat it for each new session.

Alternatively, you can launch the environment with the `lineapy` command, like so:

```bash
lineapy jupyter notebook
```

```bash
lineapy jupyter lab
```

```bash
lineapy ipython
```

This will automatically load the LineaPy extension in the corresponding interactive shell application,
and you will not need to manually load it for every new session.

*NOTE:* If your Jupyter environment has multiple kernels, choose `Python 3 (ipykernel)` which `lineapy`
defaults to.

#### CLI

You can also use LineaPy as a CLI command or a runnable Python module. Run:

```bash
# LineaPy as a CLI command
lineapy python --help
```

or

```bash
# LineaPy as a runnable Python module
python -m lineapy --help
```

to see available options.

### Quick Start

Once LineaPy is installed and loaded, you are ready to start using the package. Let's use a simple
example using the [Iris dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iris_flower_data_set) to demonstrate
how to use LineaPy to 1) store a variable's history, 2) get its cleaned-up code,
and 3) build an executable pipeline for the variable.

Consider development code looking as follows:

```python
import lineapy
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Load data
url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/main/examples/tutorials/data/iris.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)

# Map each species to a color
color_map = {"Setosa": "green", "Versicolor": "blue", "Virginica": "red"}
df["variety_color"] = df["variety"].map(color_map)

# Plot petal vs. sepal width by species
df.plot.scatter("petal.width", "sepal.width", c="variety_color")
plt.show()

# Create dummy variables encoding species
df["d_versicolor"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Versicolor" else 0)
df["d_virginica"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Virginica" else 0)

# Initiate the model
mod = LinearRegression()

# Fit the model
mod.fit(
    X=df[["petal.width", "d_versicolor", "d_virginica"]],
    y=df["sepal.width"],
)
```

Now, say you reached the end of your development and decided to save the trained model.
You can store the model as a LineaPy [artifact](https://docs.lineapy.org/en/latest/fundamentals/concepts.html#artifact) as follows:

```python
# Save the model as an artifact
lineapy.save(mod, "iris_model")
```

A LineaPy artifact encapsulates both the value *and* code, so you can easily retrieve
the model's code, like so:

```python
# Retrieve the model artifact
artifact = lineapy.get("iris_model")

# Check code for the model artifact
print(artifact.get_code())
```

which will print:

```
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

url = "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/main/examples/tutorials/data/iris.csv"
df = pd.read_csv(url)
color_map = {"Setosa": "green", "Versicolor": "blue", "Virginica": "red"}
df["variety_color"] = df["variety"].map(color_map)
df["d_versicolor"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Versicolor" else 0)
df["d_virginica"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Virginica" else 0)
mod = LinearRegression()
mod.fit(
    X=df[["petal.width", "d_versicolor", "d_virginica"]],
    y=df["sepal.width"],
)
```

Note that these are the minimal essential steps to produce the model. That is, LineaPy has automatically
cleaned up the original code by removing extraneous operations that do not affect the model (e.g., plotting).

Say you are now asked to retrain the model on a regular basis to account for any updates in the source data.
You need to set up a pipeline to train the model, which LineaPy makes as simple as a single function call:

```python
lineapy.to_pipeline(
    artifacts=["iris_model"],
    input_parameters=["url"],  # Specify variable(s) to parametrize
    pipeline_name="iris_model_pipeline",
    output_dir="output/",
    framework="AIRFLOW",
)
```

which generates several files that can be used to execute the pipeline from the UI or CLI (check this
[tutorial](https://docs.lineapy.org/en/latest/guide/build_pipelines/pipeline_basics.html) for more details).

In sum, LineaPy automates time-consuming, manual steps in a data science workflow, helping us move
our work into production more quickly.

## Usage Reporting

LineaPy collects anonymous usage data that helps our team to improve the product.
Only LineaPy's API calls and CLI commands are being reported.
We strip out as much potentially sensitive information as possible, and we will
never collect user code, data, variable names, or stack traces.

You can opt-out of usage tracking by setting environment variable:

```bash
export LINEAPY_DO_NOT_TRACK=true
```
