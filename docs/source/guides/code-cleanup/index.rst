Code Cleanup
============

Data science development is characterized by nimble, iterative experimentation and exploratory data analysis.
Data scientists explore many possibilities before reaching the final result. The rapid exploration process often
leads to long, messy code, the majority of which has no impact on the final result.

Code cleanup is hence an essential step for moving data science work into production. Yet, it often becomes a major
bottleneck as it involves manual inspection of long, messy code that sometimes does not make sense even to its own
author. With the complete development history stored in artifacts, LineaPy enables automatic code cleanup,
facilitating transition to production.
