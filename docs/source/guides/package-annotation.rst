Annotating Third-Party APIs
===========================

.. include:: /snippets/slack_support.rstinc

Python ecosystem offers a lot of interesting and useful packages that are not part of the core distribution.
These third-party packages often come with their own new APIs, and LineaPy is not guaranteed to handle all
of them properly when removing extraneous code. For such "unrecognized" APIs, we can add
instructions for LineaPy, which we call "package annotation".

For instance, without relevant package annotation, running

.. code-block:: python

   import pyperclip

   pyperclip.copy("This wont show up without annotations")
   tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()
   artifact = lineapy.save(tmp_var, "annotated_text")

   print(artifact.get_code())

would display

.. code-block:: none

   import pyperclip

   tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()

where the ``pyperclip.copy`` step is missing. This is because ``lineapy`` does not recognize it
as an API that modifies the caller (``pyperclip``, in this case) and hence skips it
during the relevant code cleanup.

We can annotate the ``pyperclip`` package by creating a YAML file looking as follows:

.. code-block:: yaml

   # ./pyperclip.annotations.yaml

   - module: pyperclip
     annotations:
       - criteria:
           function_names:
             - copy
             - paste
         side_effects:
           - mutated_value:
               self_ref: SELF_REF

where

* ``module`` refers to the third-party package/module that the annotation is associated with.

* ``criteria`` specifies what each annotation is *for*. In this example, it instructs that the annotation is for ``copy`` and ``paste`` functions in the module.

* ``side_effects`` specifies what each annotation is *about*. In this example, it instructs that the annotation is about mutation of the function caller.

In sum, these instructions tell ``lineapy`` to recognize ``copy`` and ``paste`` functions in the ``pyperclip`` module
as APIs that mutate their caller, and to treat them as such in relevant downstream tasks such as code cleanup.

.. note::

   For more details on annotation keywords, check this :ref:`page <annotate_package>`.

To make the annotation take effect, we run:

.. code-block:: bash

   lineapy annotate add "./pyperclip.annotations.yaml" --name="pyperclip_annotations" 

where ``"pyperclip_annotations"`` is a name of our choice.

Now, if we reload ``lineapy`` and run the original code above, we get the correct code cleanup displayed:

.. code-block:: none

   import pyperclip

   pyperclip.copy("This wont show up without annotations")
   tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()

.. warning::

   Annotations added this way are valid in the local environment only.
   To integrate new annotations into the ``lineapy`` source code, the YAML file
   should be created or updated in `lineapy/annotations/external/ <https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/tree/main/lineapy/annotations/external>`_,
   following contribution instructions :ref:`here <contribution_setup_and_basics>`.

To view imported annotations, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   lineapy annotate list

To delete imported annotations, run:

.. code-block:: bash

   lineapy annotate delete --name=[NAME-OF-ANNOTATION]

where ``[NAME-OF-ANNOTATION]`` is ``"pyperclip_annotations"`` in this example.
