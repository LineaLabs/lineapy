Artifact Store
==============

LineaPy saves artifacts in the artifact store, which is a centralized repository for artifacts and
their metadata (e.g., creation time, version). LineaPy's artifact store is globally accessible, which means
the user can view, load, and build on artifacts across different development sessions and even different projects.
This unified global storage is designed to accelerate the overall development process, which is iterative in nature.
Moreover, it can facilitate collaboration between different teams as it provides a single source of truth for all prior relevant work.
