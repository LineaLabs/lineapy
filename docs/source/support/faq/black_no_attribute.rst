Why do I get an error for ``module 'black' has no attribute``?
==============================================================

Lineapy uses the `black library <https://pypi.org/project/black/>`_ to format produced code. Make sure you have the version of black as specified in `LineaPy's requirements.txt <https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/blob/main/requirements.txt>`_.
