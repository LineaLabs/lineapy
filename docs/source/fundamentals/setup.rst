Installation
============

To install LineaPy, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install lineapy

Or, if you want the latest version of LineaPy directly from the source, run:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy.git --upgrade

.. note::

    By default, LineaPy uses SQLite for artifact store, which keeps the package light and simple.
    If you want to use a more robust database, please follow :ref:`instructions <postgres>` for using PostgreSQL.
