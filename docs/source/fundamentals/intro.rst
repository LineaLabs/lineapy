LineaPy 101
===========

What is LineaPy?
----------------

LineaPy is a Python package for capturing, analyzing, and automating data science workflows.
On a high level, LineaPy traces the sequence of code execution to form a comprehensive understanding
of the code and its context. This understanding allows LineaPy to provide a set of tools that help
data scientists to bring their work to production more quickly and easily.

Why Use LineaPy?
----------------

Going from development to production is full of friction. Data engineering is a manual and
time-consuming process. A proliferation of libraries, tools, and technologies means data teams
spend countless hours managing infrastructure and repeating tasks. This drastically reduces
the teamâ€™s ability to deliver actionable insights in real-time.

LineaPy creates a frictionless path for taking your data science work from development to production,
backed by a decade of research and industry expertise tackling hyperscale data challenges.

.. topic:: *Data Engineering, Simplified*

    Your data science artifact works, now comes the cleanup. LineaPy extracts essential operations
    from the messy development code in minutes not days, simplifying data engineering with just
    two lines of code.

.. topic:: *You Analyze, We Productionize*

    Productionization is manual, messy, and it requires software engineering expertise
    to create clean, reproducible code. LineaPy automatically handles lineage and refactoring
    so you can focus on experimenting, analyzing, and modeling.

.. topic:: *Move Fast from Prototype to Pipeline*

    LineaPy automates code translations to save you time and help you stay focused. Rapidly
    create analytics pipelines with a simple API &mdash; no refactoring or new tools needed.
    Go from your Jupyter notebook to an Airflow pipeline in minutes.
