Building Pipelines
==================

Basics
------

Data science workflows revolve around building and refining pipelines, i.e., a series of processes that transform data into useful information/product
(read more about pipelines :ref:`here <concepts>`).

Traditionally, this is often manual and time-consuming work as data scientists (or production engineers) need to transform messy development code
into deployable scripts for the target system (e.g., Airflow).

Having the complete development process stored in artifacts, LineaPy can automate such code transformation, accelerating transition from development to production.

For example, consider a simple pipeline that 1) pre-processes raw data and 2) trains a model with the pre-processed data.

  :width: 600
  :align: center
  :alt: Pipeline Example

Once we have the pre-processed data and the trained model stored as LineaPy artifacts (which can be done during development sessions),
building a pipeline reduces to “stitching” these artifacts, like so:

.. code:: python

   import lineapy

   # Load artifacts to use in pipeline building
   preprocessing_art = lineapy.get("iris_preprocessed")
   modeling_art = lineapy.get("iris_model")

   # Build an Airflow pipeline using artifacts
   lineapy.to_pipeline(
      artifacts=[
         preprocessing_art.name,
         modeling_art.name,
      ],
      pipeline_name="demo_airflow_pipeline",
      dependencies={
         modeling_art.name: { preprocessing_art.name},
      },
      output_dir="output/02_build_pipelines/demo_airflow_pipeline/",
      framework="AIRFLOW",
   )

where

* ``artifacts`` is the list of artifact names to be used for the pipeline

* ``pipeline_name`` is the name of the pipeline

* ``dependencies`` is the dependency graph among artifacts

  * If artifact A depends on artifacts B and C, then the graph is specified as ``{ A: { B, C } }``

  * If A depends on B and B depends on C, then the graph is specified as ``{ A: { B }, B: { C } }``

* ``output_dir`` is the location to put the files for running the pipeline

* ``framework`` is the name of orchestration framework to use

  * LineaPy currently supports ``"AIRFLOW"`` and ``"SCRIPT"``

  * If ``"AIRFLOW"``, it will generate files that can run Airflow DAGs

  * If ``"SCRIPT"``, it will generate files that can run the pipeline as a Python script

Running :func:`lineapy.to_pipeline` generates several files that can be used to execute the pipeline from the UI or CLI, including:

* ``<pipeline_name>.py``: Contains the artifact code packaged as a function module

* ``<pipeline_name>_dag.py``: Uses the packaged function(s) to define the pipeline

* ``<pipeline_name>_requirements.txt``: Lists any package dependencies for running the pipeline

* ``<pipeline_name>_Dockerfile``: Contains commands to set up the environment to run the pipeline

where ``<pipeline_name>`` is ``demo_airflow_pipeline`` in the current example.

Output Files
------------

Let's take a closer look at these files. First, we have ``demo_airflow_pipeline.py`` looking as follows:

.. code:: python

   import pickle


   def iris_preprocessed():

      import pandas as pd

      df = pd.read_csv(
         "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/main/examples/tutorials/data/iris.csv"
      )
      color_map = {"Setosa": "green", "Versicolor": "blue", "Virginica": "red"}
      df["variety_color"] = df["variety"].map(color_map)
      df["d_versicolor"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Versicolor" else 0)
      df["d_virginica"] = df["variety"].apply(lambda x: 1 if x == "Virginica" else 0)
      pickle.dump(df, open("/Users/sangyoonpark/.lineapy/linea_pickles/JIzXR8u", "wb"))


   def iris_model():

      from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

      df_processed = pickle.load(
         open("/Users/sangyoonpark/.lineapy/linea_pickles/JIzXR8u", "rb")
      )
      mod = LinearRegression()
      mod.fit(
         X=df_processed[["petal.width", "d_versicolor", "d_virginica"]],
         y=df_processed["sepal.width"],
      )
      pickle.dump(mod, open("/Users/sangyoonpark/.lineapy/linea_pickles/k5pyaTX", "wb"))

We can see that LineaPy used artifacts to automatically 1) clean up their code to retain only essential operations and 2) package the cleaned-up code into importable functions.

And we see ``demo_airflow_pipeline_dag.py`` automatically composing an Airflow DAG with these functions:

.. code:: python

   import os

   import demo_airflow_pipeline
   from airflow import DAG
   from airflow.operators.python_operator import PythonOperator
   from airflow.utils.dates import days_ago

   default_dag_args = {"owner": "airflow", "retries": 2, "start_date": days_ago(1)}

   dag = DAG(
      dag_id="demo_airflow_pipeline_dag",
      schedule_interval="*/15 * * * *",
      max_active_runs=1,
      catchup=False,
      default_args=default_dag_args,
   )


   iris_preprocessed = PythonOperator(
      dag=dag,
      task_id="iris_preprocessed_task",
      python_callable=demo_airflow_pipeline.iris_preprocessed,
   )

   iris_model = PythonOperator(
      dag=dag,
      task_id="iris_model_task",
      python_callable=demo_airflow_pipeline.iris_model,
   )


   iris_preprocessed >> iris_model

Next, we see ``demo_airflow_pipeline_requirements.txt`` listing dependencies for running the pipeline:

.. code:: none

   matplotlib==3.5.1
   numpy==1.21.5
   lineapy==0.0.5

Finally, we have the automatically generated Dockerfile (``demo_airflow_pipeline_Dockerfile``), which facilitates pipeline execution:

.. code:: docker

   FROM apache/airflow:latest

   RUN mkdir /tmp/installers
   WORKDIR /tmp/installers

   # copy all the requirements to run the current dag
   COPY ./demo_airflow_pipeline_requirements.txt ./
   # install the required libs
   RUN pip install -r ./demo_airflow_pipeline_requirements.txt

   WORKDIR /opt/airflow/dags
   COPY . .

   WORKDIR /opt/airflow

   CMD [ "standalone" ]

.. _testingairflow:

Testing Locally
---------------

With these automatically generated files, we can quickly test running the pipeline locally.
First, we run the following command to build a Docker image:

.. code:: bash

    docker build -t <image_name> . -f <pipeline_name>_Dockerfile

where ``<pipeline_name>_Dockerfile`` is the name of the automatically generated Dockerfile and
``<image_name>`` is the image name of our choice.

We then stand up a container instance with the following command:

.. code:: bash

    docker run -it -p 8080:8080 <image_name>

In the current example where we set ``framework="AIRFLOW"``, this will result in an Airflow instance
with an executable DAG in it.
