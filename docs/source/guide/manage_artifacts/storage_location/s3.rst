.. _s3:

Storing Artifact Values in Amazon S3
------------------------------------

.. include:: ../../../snippets/slack_support.rstinc

To use S3 as LineaPy's serialized value location, you can run the following command in your notebook to change your storage backend:

.. code:: python

    lineapy.options.set('artifact_storage_dir', 's3://your-bucket/your-artifact-folder')

You should configure your AWS account just like you would for `AWS CLI <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html>`_ or `boto3 <https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/guide/credentials.html>`_,
and LineaPy will use the default AWS credentials to access the S3 bucket.

If you want to use other profiles available in your AWS configuration, you can set the profile name with:

.. code:: python

    lineapy.options.set('storage_options', {'profile': 'ANOTHER_AWS_PROFILE'})

which is equivalent to setting your environment variable ``AWS_PROFILE`` to the profile name.

If you really need to set your AWS credentials directly in the running session (strongly discouraged as it may result in accidentally saving these credentials), you can set them with:

.. code:: python

    lineapy.options.set('storage_options', {'key': 'AWS KEY', 'secret': 'AWS SECRET'})

which is equivalent to setting environment variables ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` and ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``.

To learn more about which S3 configuration items that you can set in ``storage_options``, you can see the parameters of `s3fs.S3FileSystem <https://s3fs.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api.html>`_ since ``fsspec`` is passing ``storage_options`` items to ``s3fs.S3FileSystem`` to access S3 under the hood.
