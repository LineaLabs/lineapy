# Annotating Third-Party APIs

Python ecosystem offers a lot of interesting and useful packages that are not part of the core distribution.
These third-party packages often come with their own new APIs, and LineaPy is not guaranteed to handle all
of them properly when removing extraneous code. For such "unrecognized" APIs, we can add
instructions for LineaPy, which we call "package annotation".

For instance, without relevant package annotation, running

```python
import pyperclip

pyperclip.copy("This wont show up without annotations")
tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()
artifact = lineapy.save(tmp_var, "annotated_text")

print(artifact.get_code())
```

would display

```
import pyperclip

tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()
```

where the `pyperclip.copy` step is missing. This is because `lineapy` does not recognize it
as an API that modifies the caller (`pyperclip`, in this case) and hence skips it
during the relevant code cleanup.

We can annotate the `pyperclip` package by creating a YAML file looking as follows:

```yaml
# ./pyperclip.annotations.yaml

- module: pyperclip
  annotations:
    - criteria:
        function_names:
          - copy
          - paste
      side_effects:
        - mutated_value:
            self_ref: SELF_REF
```

where

* `module` refers to the third-party package/module that the annotation is associated with.

* `criteria` specifies what each annotation is *for*. In this example, it instructs that the annotation is for `copy` and `paste` functions in the module.

* `side_effects` specifies what each annotation is *about*. In this example, it instructs that the annotation is about mutation of the function caller.

In sum, these instructions tell `lineapy` to recognize `copy` and `paste` functions in the `pyperclip` module
as APIs that mutate their caller, and to treat them as such in relevant downstream tasks such as code cleanup.

!!! info

    For more details on annotation keywords, check this [page](../contributing/areas/annotate-package.md).

To make the annotation take effect, we run:

```bash
lineapy annotate add "./pyperclip.annotations.yaml" --name="pyperclip_annotations" 
```

where `"pyperclip_annotations"` is a name of our choice.

Now, if we reload `lineapy` and run the original code above, we get the correct code cleanup displayed:

```
import pyperclip

pyperclip.copy("This wont show up without annotations")
tmp_var = pyperclip.paste()
```

!!! warning

    Annotations added this way are valid in the local environment only.
    To integrate new annotations into the `lineapy` source code, the YAML file
    should be created or updated in [`lineapy/annotations/external/`](https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/tree/main/lineapy/annotations/external),
    following contribution instructions [here](../contributing/setup.md).

To view imported annotations, run:

```bash
lineapy annotate list
```

To delete imported annotations, run:

```bash
lineapy annotate delete --name=[NAME-OF-ANNOTATION]
```

where `[NAME-OF-ANNOTATION]` is `"pyperclip_annotations"` in this example.
