# Contribution Process

First of all, thank you for your interest in contributing to LineaPy!
We believe that it is the community that makes an open source project truly great
and successful, so we welcome contribution from any new members.

To contribute to LineaPy, you can take the following three steps: 1) open an issue; 2) triage the issue; and 3) implement the solution.

## 1. Open an Issue

First, check existing tickets on LineaPy's [issue tracker](https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/issues)
to see if any of them already addresses your concern. If none, open a new one with as much detail about your issue
as possible. We currently provide [templates](https://github.com/LineaLabs/lineapy/issues/new/choose)
for two types of issues (`Feature Request` and `Bug Report`), but feel free to adapt them to suit your particular needs/contexts.

## 2. Triage the Issue

Once a new issue has been filed, LineaPy's core development team will be soon in touch through replies in the issue ticket.
The main purpose of this interaction is to clarify and flesh out any missing details about the issue so that the ticket can be
turned into a concrete action plan with clearer scope and priority. You will also collaborate with the core development team
to decide stakeholders for the issue resolution, such as implementation owner and reviewers/approvers.

!!! info

    If your issue demands more prompt attention and/or tighter interaction, please get in touch in our
    [Slack community](https://join.slack.com/t/lineacommunity/shared_invite/zt-18kizfn3b-1Qu_HDT3ahGudnAwoFAw9Q)'s
    `#support` channel.

## 3. Implement the Solution

Unless the issue resolution requires deeper expertise or larger scope (e.g., architectural change), you will be highly encouraged
to be the implementation owner. If so, you can follow instructions in [Setup and Basics](setup.md) to start
your work. We view implementation as a collaborative process too, so please feel free to engage the [LineaPy community](../support.md)
for any questions, concerns, and/or advice.
