# LineaPy Tutorials

## `00_api_basics`

This tutorial gives you a quick tour of core functionalities of LineaPy. If you are new to LineaPy, start here!

## `01_refactor_code`

A major bottleneck in data science work is refactoring messy development code into clean, production-ready code. LineaPy's support for automatic code clean-up can boost the productivity and impact of data science teams. This tutorial demonstrates how this can be done.

## `02_build_pipelines`

Data science workflows revolve around building and refining pipelines, but it is often manual and time-consuming work. Having the complete development process stored in artifacts, LineaPy can automate pipeline building, accelerating transition from development to production. This tutorial demonstrates how this can be done.

## `03_parametrize_pipelines`

Oftentimes, data scientists/engineers need to run the same pipeline with different parameters. For instance, they may want to use a different data set for model training and/or prediction. 
This tutorial demonstrates how to produce a parametrized pipeline.
