# **DataFrame.describe()** method generates descriptive statistics that summarize the central tendency, dispersion and shape of a dataset‚Äôs distribution, excluding NaN values. This method tells us a lot of things about a dataset. One important thing is that the describe() method deals only with numeric values. It doesn't work with any categorical values. So if there are any categorical values in a column the describe() method will ignore it and display summary for the other columns unless parameter include="all" is passed.
#
# Now, let's understand the statistics that are generated by the describe() method:
# * count tells us the number of NoN-empty rows in a feature.
# * mean tells us the mean value of that feature.
# * std tells us the Standard Deviation Value of that feature.
# * min tells us the minimum value of that feature.
# * 25%, 50%, and 75% are the percentile/quartile of each features. This quartile information helps us to detect Outliers.
# * max tells us the maximum value of that feature.

#
# #### Can minimum value of below listed columns be zero (0)?
#
# On these columns, a value of zero does not make sense and thus indicates missing value.
#
# Following columns or variables have an invalid zero value:
# 1. Glucose
# 2. BloodPressure
# 3. SkinThickness
# 4. Insulin
# 5. BMI

# #### It is better to replace zeros with nan since after that counting them would be easier and zeros need to be replaced with suitable values

# In[6]:

diabetes_data_copy[
    ["Glucose", "BloodPressure", "SkinThickness", "Insulin", "BMI"]

# ## Skewness
#
# A ***left-skewed distribution*** has a long left tail. Left-skewed distributions are also called negatively-skewed distributions. That‚Äôs because there is a long tail in the negative direction on the number line. The mean is also to the left of the peak.
#
# A ***right-skewed distribution*** has a long right tail. Right-skewed distributions are also called positive-skew distributions. That‚Äôs because there is a long tail in the positive direction on the number line. The mean is also to the right of the peak.

# ### Why Scaling the data for KNN?

# #### it is always advisable to bring all the features to the same scale for applying distance based algorithms like KNN.
# ##### Let's see an example of distance calculation using two features whose magnitudes/ranges vary greatly.
# Euclidean Distance = [(100000‚Äì80000)^2 + (30‚Äì25)^2]^(1/2)

# #### We can imagine how the feature with greater range with overshadow or dimenish the smaller feature completely and this will impact the performance of all distance based model as it will give higher weightage to variables which have higher magnitude.

# ## Test Train Split and Cross Validation methods
#
#
#
# ***Train Test Split*** : To have unknown datapoints to test the data rather than testing with the same points with which the model was trained. This helps capture the model performance much better.
#
# ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*-8_kogvwmL1H6ooN1A1tsQ.png)
#
# ***Cross Validation***: When model is split into training and testing it can be possible that specific type of data point may go entirely into either training or testing portion. This would lead the model to perform poorly. Hence over-fitting and underfitting problems can be well avoided with cross validation techniques
#
# ![](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*4G__SV580CxFj78o9yUXuQ.png)
#
#
# ***About Stratify*** : Stratify parameter makes a split so that the proportion of values in the sample produced will be the same as the proportion of values provided to parameter stratify.
#
# For example, if variable y is a binary categorical variable with values 0 and 1 and there are 25% of zeros and 75% of ones, stratify=y will make sure that your random split has 25% of 0's and 75% of 1's.

# ### ***In the famous cancer example***:

# ## 2. Classification Report
#
# Report which includes Precision, Recall and F1-Score.
#
#
# #### Precision Score
#         TP ‚Äì True Positives
#         FP ‚Äì False Positives
#
#         Precision ‚Äì Accuracy of positive predictions.
#         Precision = TP/(TP + FP)
#
#
# #### Recall Score
#         FN ‚Äì False Negatives
#
#         Recall(sensitivity or true positive rate): Fraction of positives that were correctly identified.
#         Recall = TP/(TP+FN)
#
# #### F1 Score
#         F1 Score (aka F-Score or F-Measure) ‚Äì A helpful metric for comparing two classifiers.
#         F1 Score takes into account precision and the recall.
#         It is created by finding the the harmonic mean of precision and recall.
#
#         F1 = 2 x (precision x recall)/(precision + recall)
#
#
#
# > > ***Precision*** - Precision is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the total predicted positive observations. The question that this metric answer is of all passengers that labeled as survived, how many actually survived? High precision relates to the low false positive rate. We have got 0.788 precision which is pretty good.
# > >
# > > Precision = TP/TP+FP
# > >
# > > ***Recall (Sensitivity)*** - Recall is the ratio of correctly predicted positive observations to the all observations in actual class - yes. The question recall answers is: Of all the passengers that truly survived, how many did we label? A recall greater than 0.5 is good.
# > >
# > > Recall = TP/TP+FN
# > >
# > > ***F1 score*** - F1 Score is the weighted average of Precision and Recall. Therefore, this score takes both false positives and false negatives into account. Intuitively it is not as easy to understand as accuracy, but F1 is usually more useful than accuracy, especially if you have an uneven class distribution. Accuracy works best if false positives and false negatives have similar cost. If the cost of false positives and false negatives are very different, it‚Äôs better to look at both Precision and Recall.
# > >
# > > F1 Score = 2*(Recall * Precision) / (Recall + Precision)

# # Hyper Parameter optimization
# Grid search is an approach to hyperparameter tuning that will methodically build and evaluate a model for each combination of algorithm parameters specified in a grid.
#
# Let‚Äôs consider the following example:
#
# Suppose, a machine learning model X takes hyperparameters a1, a2 and a3. In grid searching, you first define the range of values for each of the hyperparameters a1, a2 and a3. You can think of this as an array of values for each of the hyperparameters. Now the grid search technique will construct many versions of X with all the possible combinations of hyperparameter (a1, a2 and a3) values that you defined in the first place. This range of hyperparameter values is referred to as the grid.
#
# Suppose, you defined the grid as:
# a1 = [0,1,2,3,4,5]
# a2 = [10,20,30,40,5,60]
# a3 = [105,105,110,115,120,125]
#
# Note that, the array of values of that you are defining for the hyperparameters has to be legitimate in a sense that you cannot supply Floating type values to the array if the hyperparameter only takes Integer values.
#
# Now, grid search will begin its process of constructing several versions of X with the grid that you just defined.
#
# It will start with the combination of [0,10,105], and it will end with [5,60,125]. It will go through all the intermediate combinations between these two which makes grid search computationally very expensive.
