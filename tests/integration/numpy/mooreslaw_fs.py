# # Determining Moore's Law with real data in NumPy
# ![Scatter plot of MOS transistor count per microprocessor every two years as a demonstration of Moore's Law.](_static/01-mooreslaw-tutorial-intro.png)
#
# _The number of transistors reported per a given chip plotted on a log scale in the y axis with the date of introduction on the linear scale x-axis. The blue data points are from a [transistor count table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors). The red line is an ordinary least squares prediction and the orange line is Moore's law._
#
# ## What you'll do
#
# In 1965, engineer Gordon Moore
# [predicted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) that
# transistors on a chip would double every two years in the coming decade
# [[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law),
# [2](https://newsroom.intel.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2018/05/moores-law-electronics.pdf)].
# You'll compare Moore's prediction against actual transistor counts in
# the 53 years following his prediction. You will determine the best-fit constants to describe the exponential growth of transistors on semiconductors compared to Moore's Law.
#
#
# ## Skills you'll learn
#
#
# - Load data from a [\*.csv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) file
# - Perform linear regression and predict exponential growth using ordinary least squares
# - You'll compare exponential growth constants between models
# - Share your analysis in a file:
#     - as NumPy zipped files `*.npz`
#     - as a `*.csv` file
# - Assess the amazing progress semiconductor manufacturers have made in the last five decades
#
# ## What you'll need
#
# **1.** These packages:
#
# * NumPy
# * [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)
# * [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org) ordinary linear regression
#
# imported with the following commands

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import statsmodels.api as sm

# **2.** Since this is an exponential growth law you need a little background in doing math with [natural logs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm) and [exponentials](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exponential_function).
#
# You'll use these NumPy, Matplotlib, and statsmodels functions:
#
# * [`np.loadtxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html): this function loads text into a NumPy array
# * [`np.log`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.log.html): this function takes the natural log of all elements in a NumPy array
# * [`np.exp`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.exp.html): this function takes the exponential of all elements in a NumPy array
# * [`lambda`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html?highlight=lambda#ast.Lambda): this is a minimal function definition for creating a function model
# * [`plt.semilogy`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.semilogy.html): this function will plot x-y data onto a figure with a linear x-axis and $\log_{10}$ y-axis
# [`plt.plot`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html): this function will plot x-y data on linear axes
# * [`sm.OLS`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html): find fitting parameters and standard errors using the statsmodels ordinary least squares model
# * slicing arrays: view parts of the data loaded into the workspace, slice the arrays e.g. `x[:10]` for the first 10 values in the array, `x`
# * boolean array indexing: to view parts of the data that match a given condition use boolean operations to index an array
# * [`np.block`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.block.html): to combine arrays into 2D arrays
# * [`np.newaxis`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html): to change a 1D vector to a row or column vector
# * [`np.savez`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html) and [`np.savetxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savetxt.html): these two functions will save your arrays in zipped array format and text, respectively

#
# ## Building Moore's law as an exponential function
#
# Your empirical model assumes that the number of transistors per
# semiconductor follows an exponential growth,
#
# $\log(\text{transistor_count})= f(\text{year}) = A\cdot \text{year}+B,$
#
# where $A$ and $B$ are fitting constants. You use semiconductor
# manufacturers' data to find the fitting constants.
#
# You determine these constants for Moore's law by specifying the
# rate for added transistors, 2, and giving an initial number of transistors for a given year.
#
# You state Moore's law in an exponential form as follows,
#
# $\text{transistor_count}= e^{A_M\cdot \text{year} +B_M}.$
#
# Where $A_M$ and $B_M$ are constants that double the number of transistors every two years and start at 2250 transistors in 1971,
#
# 1. $\dfrac{\text{transistor_count}(\text{year} +2)}{\text{transistor_count}(\text{year})} = 2 = \dfrac{e^{B_M}e^{A_M \text{year} + 2A_M}}{e^{B_M}e^{A_M \text{year}}} = e^{2A_M} \rightarrow A_M = \frac{\log(2)}{2}$
#
# 2. $\log(2250) = \frac{\log(2)}{2}\cdot 1971 + B_M \rightarrow B_M = \log(2250)-\frac{\log(2)}{2}\cdot 1971$
#
# so Moore's law stated as an exponential function is
#
# $\log(\text{transistor_count})= A_M\cdot \text{year}+B_M,$
#
# where
#
# $A_M=0.3466$
#
# $B_M=-675.4$
#
# Since the function represents Moore's law, define it as a Python
# function using
# [`lambda`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/ast.html?highlight=lambda#ast.Lambda)

A_M = np.log(2) / 2
B_M = np.log(2250) - A_M * 1971
Moores_law = lambda year: np.exp(B_M) * np.exp(A_M * year)

# In 1971, there were 2250 transistors on the Intel 4004 chip. Use
# `Moores_law` to check the number of semiconductors Gordon Moore would expect
# in 1973.

ML_1971 = Moores_law(1971)
ML_1973 = Moores_law(1973)
print(
    "In 1973, G. Moore expects {:.0f} transistors on Intels chips".format(
        ML_1973
    )
)
print("This is x{:.2f} more transistors than 1971".format(ML_1973 / ML_1971))

# ## Loading historical manufacturing data to your workspace
#
# Now, make a prediction based upon the historical data for
# semiconductors per chip. The [Transistor Count
# \[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transistor_count#Microprocessors)
# each year is in the `transistor_data.csv` file. Before loading a \*.csv
# file into a NumPy array, its a good idea to inspect the structure of the
# file first. Then, locate the columns of interest and save them to a
# variable. Save two columns of the file to the array, `data`.
#
# Here, print out the first 10 rows of `transistor_data.csv`. The columns are
#
# |Processor|MOS transistor count|Date of Introduction|Designer|MOSprocess|Area|
# |---|---|---|---|---|---|
# |Intel 4004 (4-bit  16-pin)|2250|1971|Intel|"10,000 nm"|12 mm²|
# |...|...|...|...|...|...|

# ! head transistor_data.csv

# You don't need the columns that specify __Processor__, __Designer__,
# __MOSprocess__, or __Area__. That leaves the second and third columns,
# __MOS transistor count__ and __Date of Introduction__, respectively.
#
# Next, you load these two columns into a NumPy array using
# [`np.loadtxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.loadtxt.html).
# The extra options below will put the data in the desired format:
#
# * `delimiter = ','`: specify delimeter as a comma ',' (this is the default behavior)
# * `usecols = [1,2]`: import the second and third columns from the csv
# * `skiprows = 1`: do not use the first row, because its a header row

data = np.loadtxt(
    "transistor_data.csv", delimiter=",", usecols=[1, 2], skiprows=1
)

# You loaded the entire history of semiconducting into a NumPy array named
# `data`. The first column is the __MOS transistor count__ and the second
# column is the __Date of Introduction__ in a four-digit year.
#
# Next, make the data easier to read and manage by assigning the two
# columns to variables, `year` and `transistor_count`. Print out the first
# 10 values by slicing the `year` and `transistor_count` arrays with
# `[:10]`. Print these values out to check that you have the saved the
# data to the correct variables.

# +
year = data[:, 1]  # grab the second column and assign
transistor_count = data[:, 0]  # grab the first column and assign

print("year:\t\t", year[:10])
print("trans. cnt:\t", transistor_count[:10])
# -

# You are creating a function that predicts the transistor count given a
# year. You have an _independent variable_, `year`, and a _dependent
# variable_, `transistor_count`. Transform the independent variable to
# log-scale,
#
# $y_i = \log($ `transistor_count[i]` $),$
#
# resulting in a linear equation,
#
# $y_i = A\cdot \text{year} +B$.

yi = np.log(transistor_count)

# ## Calculating the historical growth curve for transistors
#
# Your model assume that `yi` is a function of `year`. Now, find the best-fit model that minimizes the difference between $y_i$ and $A\cdot \text{year} +B, $ as such
#
# $\min \sum|y_i - (A\cdot \text{year}_i + B)|^2.$
#
# This [sum of squares
# error](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordinary_least_squares) can be
# succinctly represented as arrays as such
#
# $\sum|\mathbf{y}-\mathbf{Z} [A,~B]^T|^2,$
#
# where $\mathbf{y}$ are the observations of the log of the number of
# transistors in a 1D array and $\mathbf{Z}=[\text{year}_i^1,~\text{year}_i^0]$ are the
# polynomial terms for $\text{year}_i$ in the first and second columns. By
# creating this set of regressors in the $\mathbf{Z}-$matrix you set
# up an ordinary least squares statistical model. Some clever
# NumPy array features will build $\mathbf{Z}$
#
# 1. `year[:,np.newaxis]` : takes the 1D array with shape `(179,)` and turns it into a 2D column vector with shape `(179,1)`
# 2. `**[1, 0]` : stacks two columns, in the first column is `year**1` and the second column is `year**0 == 1`

Z = year[:, np.newaxis] ** [1, 0]

# Now that you have the created a matrix of regressors, $\mathbf{Z},$ and
# the observations are in vector, $\mathbf{y},$ you can use these
# variables to build the an ordinary least squares model with
# [`sm.OLS`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html).

model = sm.OLS(yi, Z)

# Now, you can view the fitting constants, $A$ and $B$, and their standard
# errors.  Run the
# [`fit`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.OLS.html) and print the
# [`summary`](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/generated/statsmodels.regression.linear_model.RegressionResults.summary.html) to view results as such,

results = model.fit()
print(results.summary())

# The __OLS Regression Results__ summary gives a lot of information about
# the regressors, $\mathbf{Z},$ and observations, $\mathbf{y}.$ The most
# important outputs for your current analysis are
#
# ```
# =================================
#                  coef    std err

# const       -666.3264     11.890
# =================================
# ```
# where `x1` is slope, $A=0.3416$, `const` is the intercept,
# $B=-666.364$, and `std error` gives the precision of constants
# $A=0.342\pm 0.006~\dfrac{\log(\text{transistors}/\text{chip})}{\text{years}}$ and $B=-666\pm
# 12~\log(\text{transistors}/\text{chip}),$ where the units are in
# $\log(\text{transistors}/\text{chip})$. You created an exponential growth model.
# To get the constants, save them to an array `AB` with
# `results.params` and assign $A$ and $B$ to `x1` and `constant`.

AB = results.params
A = AB[0]
B = AB[1]

# Did manufacturers double the transistor count every two years? You have

# \dfrac{e^{B}e^{A( \text{year} + 2)}}{e^{B}e^{A \text{year}}} = e^{2A}$
#
# where increase in number of transistors is $xFactor,$ number of years is
# 2, and $A$ is the best fit slope on the semilog function. The error in
# your
# prediction, $\Delta(xFactor),$ comes from the precision of your constant
# $A,$ which you calculated as the standard error $\Delta A= 0.006$.
#
# $\Delta (xFactor) = \frac{\partial}{\partial A}(e^{2A})\Delta A = 2Ae^{2A}\Delta A$

# _A scatter plot of MOS transistor count per microprocessor every two years with a red line for the ordinary least squares prediction and an orange line for Moore's law._
#
# The linear regression captures the increase in the number of transistors
# per semiconductors each year.  In 2015, semiconductor manufacturers
# claimed they could not keep up with Moore's law anymore. Your analysis
# shows that since 1971, the average increase in transistor count was
# x1.98 every 2 years, but Gordon Moore predicted it would be x2
# every 2 years. That is an amazing prediction.
#
# Consider the year 2017. Compare the data to your linear regression
# model and Gordon Moore's prediction. First, get the
# transistor counts from the year 2017. You can do this with a Boolean
# comparator,
#
# `year == 2017`.
#
# Then, make a prediction for 2017 with `Moores_law` defined above
# and plugging in your best fit constants into your function
#
# $\text{transistor_count} = e^{B}e^{A\cdot \text{year}}$.
#
# A great way to compare these measurements is to compare your prediction
# and Moore's prediction to the average transistor count and look at the
# range of reported values for that year. Use the
# [`plt.plot`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.pyplot.plot.html)
# option,
# [`alpha=0.2`](https://matplotlib.org/3.1.1/api/_as_gen/matplotlib.artist.Artist.set_alpha.html),
# to increase the transparency of the data. The more opaque the points
# appear, the more reported values lie on that measurement. The green $+$
# is the average reported transistor count for 2017. Plot your predictions
# for $\pm\frac{1}{2}~years.

# The result is that your model is close to the mean, but Gordon
# Moore's prediction is closer to the maximum number of transistors per

# thought that the growth would slow, once in 1975 and now again
# approaching 2025, manufacturers are still producing semiconductors every 2 years that
# nearly double the number of transistors.
#
# The linear regression model is much better at predicting the
# average than extreme values because it satisfies the condition to
# minimize $\sum |y_i - A\cdot \text{year}[i]+B|^2$.

# ## Sharing your results as zipped arrays and a csv
#
# The last step, is to share your findings. You created
# new arrays that represent a linear regression model and Gordon Moore's
# prediction. You started this process by importing a csv file into a NumPy
# array using `np.loadtxt`, to save your model use two approaches
#
# 1. [`np.savez`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savez.html): save NumPy arrays for other Python sessions
# 2. [`np.savetxt`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.savetxt.html): save a csv file with the original data and your predicted data
#
# ### Zipping the arrays into a file
# Using `np.savez`, you can save thousands of arrays and give them names. The
# function `np.load` will load the arrays back into the workspace as a
# dictionary. You'll save a five arrays so the next user will have the year,
# transistor count, predicted transistor count,  Gordon Moore's
# predicted count, and fitting constants. Add one more variable that other users can use to
# understand the model, `notes`.

notes = "the arrays in this file are the result of a linear regression model\n"
notes += "the arrays include\nyear: year of manufacture\n"
notes += "transistor_count: number of transistors reported by manufacturers in a given year\n"
notes += "transistor_count_predicted: linear regression model = exp({:.2f})*exp({:.2f}*year)\n".format(
    B, A
)
notes += (
    "transistor_Moores_law: Moores law =exp({:.2f})*exp({:.2f}*year)\n".format(
        B_M, A_M
    )
)
notes += "regression_csts: linear regression constants A and B for log(transistor_count)=A*year+B"
print(notes)

np.savez(
    "mooreslaw_regression.npz",
    notes=notes,
    year=year,
    transistor_count=transistor_count,
    transistor_count_predicted=transistor_count_predicted,
    transistor_Moores_law=transistor_Moores_law,
    regression_csts=AB,
)

results = np.load("mooreslaw_regression.npz")

print(results["regression_csts"][1])

# ! ls

# The benefit of `np.savez` is you can save hundreds of arrays with
# different shapes and types. Here, you saved 4 arrays that are double
# precision floating point numbers shape = `(179,)`, one array that was
# text, and one array of double precision floating point numbers shape =
# `(2,).` This is the preferred method for saving NumPy arrays for use in
# another analysis.
#
# ### Creating your own comma separated value file
#
# If you want to share data and view the results in a table, then you have to
# create a text file. Save the data using `np.savetxt`. This
# function is more limited than `np.savez`. Delimited files, like csv's,
# need 2D arrays.
#
# Prepare the data for export by creating a new 2D array whose columns
# contain the data of interest.
#
# Use the `header` option to describe the data and the columns of
# the file. Define another variable that contains file
# information as `head`.

head = "the columns in this file are the result of a linear regression model\n"
head += "the columns include\nyear: year of manufacture\n"
head += "transistor_count: number of transistors reported by manufacturers in a given year\n"
head += "transistor_count_predicted: linear regression model = exp({:.2f})*exp({:.2f}*year)\n".format(
    B, A
)
head += (
    "transistor_Moores_law: Moores law =exp({:.2f})*exp({:.2f}*year)\n".format(
        B_M, A_M
    )
)
head += "year:, transistor_count:, transistor_count_predicted:, transistor_Moores_law:"
print(head)

# Build a single 2D array to export to csv. Tabular data is inherently two
# dimensional. You need to organize your data to fit this 2D structure.
# Use `year`, `transistor_count`, `transistor_count_predicted`, and
# `transistor_Moores_law` as the first through fourth columns,
# respectively. Put the calculated constants in the header since they do
# not fit the `(179,)` shape. The
# [`np.block`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.block.html)
# function appends arrays together to create a new, larger array. Arrange
# the 1D vectors as columns using
# [`np.newaxis`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/constants.html)
# e.g.
#
# ```python
# >>> year.shape
# (179,)
# >>> year[:,np.newaxis].shape
# (179,1)
# ```

output = np.block(
    [
        year[:, np.newaxis],
        transistor_count[:, np.newaxis],
        transistor_count_predicted[:, np.newaxis],
        transistor_Moores_law[:, np.newaxis],
    ]
)

# Creating the `mooreslaw_regression.csv` with `np.savetxt`, use three
# options to create the desired file format:
#
# * `X = output` : use `output` block to write the data into the file
# * `delimiter = ','` : use commas to separate columns in the file
# * `header = head` : use the header `head` defined above

np.savetxt("mooreslaw_regression.csv", X=output, delimiter=",", header=head)

# ! head mooreslaw_regression.csv

# ## Wrapping up
#
# In conclusion, you have compared historical data for semiconductor
# manufacturers to Moore's law and created a linear regression model to
# find the average number of transistors added to each microprocessor
# every two years. Gordon Moore predicted the number of transistors would
# double every two years from 1965 through 1975, but the average growth
# has maintained a consistent increase of $\times 1.98 \pm 0.01$ every two
# years from 1971 through 2019.  In 2015, Moore revised his prediction to
# say Moore's law should hold until 2025.
# [[3](https://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/hardware/gordon-moore-the-man-whose-name-means-progress)].
# You can share these results as a zipped NumPy array file,
# `mooreslaw_regression.npz`, or as another csv,
# `mooreslaw_regression.csv`.  The amazing progress in semiconductor
# manufacturing has enabled new industries and computational power. This
# analysis should give you a small insight into how incredible this growth
# has been over the last half-century.
