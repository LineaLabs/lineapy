# # Sentiment Analysis on notable speeches of the last decade
#
# This tutorial demonstrates how to build a simple <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_short-term_memory'> Long Short Term memory network (LSTM) </a> from scratch in NumPy to perform sentiment analysis on a socially relevant and ethically acquired dataset.
#
# Your deep learning model (the LSTM) is a form of a Recurrent Neural Network and will learn to classify a piece of text as positive or negative from the IMDB reviews dataset. The dataset contains 50,000 movie reviews and corresponding labels. Based on the numeric representations of these reviews and their corresponding labels <a href = 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supervised_learning'> (supervised learning) </a> the neural network will be trained to learn the sentiment using forward propagation and backpropagation through time since we are dealing with sequential data here. The output will be a vector containing the probabilities that the text samples are positive.

# Today, Deep Learning is getting adopted in everyday life and now it is more important to ensure that decisions that have been taken using AI are not reflecting discriminatory behavior towards a set of populations. It is important to take fairness into consideration while consuming the output from AI. Throughout the tutorial we'll try to question all the steps in our pipeline from an ethics point of view.

# ## Prerequisites
#
# You are expected to be familiar with the Python programming language and array manipulation with NumPy. In addition, some understanding of Linear Algebra and Calculus is recommended. You should also be familiar with how Neural Networks work. For reference, you can visit the [Python](https://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/index.html), [Linear algebra on n-dimensional arrays](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/user/tutorial-svd.html) and [Calculus](https://d2l.ai/chapter_appendix-mathematics-for-deep-learning/multivariable-calculus.html) tutorials.
#
# To get a refresher on Deep Learning basics, You should consider reading [the d2l.ai book](https://d2l.ai/chapter_recurrent-neural-networks/index.html), which is an interactive deep learning book with multi-framework code, math, and discussions. You can also go through the [Deep learning on MNIST from scratch tutorial](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/tutorial-deep-learning-on-mnist.html) to understand how a basic neural network is implemented from scratch.
#
# In addition to NumPy, you will be utilizing the following Python standard modules for data loading and processing:
# - [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) for handling dataframes
# - [`Matplotlib`](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization
# - [`pooch`](https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/https://www.fatiando.org/pooch/latest/) to download and cache datasets
#
# This tutorial can be run locally in an isolated environment, such as [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). You can use [Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) to run each notebook cell.

# ## 1. Data Collection
#
# Before you begin there are a few pointers you should always keep in mind before choosing the data you wish to train your model on:
# - **Identifying Data Bias** - Bias is an inherent component of the human thought process. Therefore data sourced from human activities reflects that bias. Some ways in which this bias tends to occur in Machine Learning datasets are:
#     - *Bias in historical data*: Historical data are often skewed towards, or against, particular groups.
#         Data can also be severely imbalanced with limited information on protected groups.
#     - *Bias in data collection mechanisms*: Lack of representativeness introduces inherent biases in the data collection process.
#     - *Bias towards observable outcomes*: In some scenarios, we have the information about True Outcomes only for a certain section of the population. In the absence of information on all outcomes, one cannot even measure fairness
# - **Preserving human anonymity for sensitive data**: [Trevisan and Reilly](https://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/91157/1/Ethical%20dilemmas.pdf) identified a list of sensitive topics that need to be handled with extra care. We present the same below along with a few additions:
#     - personal daily routines (including location data);
#     - individual details about impairment and/or medical records;
#     - emotional accounts of pain and chronic illness;
#     - financial information about income and/or welfare payments;
#     - discrimination and abuse episodes;
#     - criticism/praise of individual providers of healthcare and support services;
#     - suicidal thoughts;
#     - criticism/praise of a power structure especially if it compromises their safety;
#     - personally-identifying information (even if anonymized in some way) including things like fingerprints or voice.
#
# >While it can be difficult taking consent from so many people especially on on-line platforms, the necessity of it depends upon the sensitivity of the topics your data includes and other indicators like whether the platform the data was obtained from allows users to operate under pseudonyms. If the website has a policy that forces the use of a real name, then the users need to be asked for consent.
#
# In this section, you will be collecting two different datasets: the IMDb movie reviews dataset, and a collection of 10 speeches curated for this tutorial including activists from different countries around the world, different times, and different topics. The former would be used to train the deep learning model while the latter will be used to perform sentiment analysis on.

# ### Collecting the IMDb reviews dataset
# IMDb Reviews Dataset is a large movie review dataset collected and prepared by Andrew L. Maas from the popular movie rating service, IMDb. The IMDb Reviews dataset is used for binary sentiment classification, whether a review is positive or negative. It contains 25,000 movie reviews for training and 25,000 for testing. All these 50,000 reviews are labeled data that may be used for supervised deep learning. For ease of reproducibility, we'll be sourcing  the data from [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/4117827#.YVQZ_EZBy3Ihttps://zenodo.org/record/4117827#.YVQZ_EZBy3I).
#    > The IMDb platform allows the usage of their public datasets for personal and non-commercial use. We did our best to ensure that these reviews do not contain any of the aforementioned sensitive topics pertaining to the reviewer.

# ### Collecting and loading the speech transcripts
# We have chosen speeches by activists around the globe talking about issues like climate change, feminism, lgbtqa+ rights and racism. These were sourced from newspapers, the official website of the United Nations and the archives of established universities as cited in the table below. A CSV file was created containing the transcribed speeches, their speaker and the source the speeches were obtained from.
# We made sure to include different demographics in our data and included a range of different topics, most of which focus on social and/or ethical issues.

# ## 2. Preprocess the datasets
# >Preprocessing data is an extremely crucial step before building any Deep learning model, however in an attempt to keep the tutorial focused on building the model, we will not dive deep into the code for preprocessing. Given below is a brief overview of all the steps we undertake to clean our data and convert it to its numeric representation.
#
# 1. **Text Denoising** : Before converting your text into vectors, it is important to clean it and remove all unhelpful parts a.k.a the noise from your data by converting all characters to lowercase, removing html tags, brackets and stop words (words that don't add much meaning to a sentence). Without this step the dataset is often a cluster of words that the computer doesn't understand.
#
#
# 2. **Converting words to vectors** : A word embedding is a learned representation for text where words that have the same meaning have a similar representation. Individual words are represented as real-valued vectors in a predefined vector space. GloVe is an unsupervised algorithm developed by Stanford for generating word embeddings by generating global word-word co-occurence matrix from a corpus. You can download the zipped files containing the embeddings from https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. Here you can choose any of the four options for different sizes or training datasets. We have chosen the least memory consuming embedding file.
#  >The GloVe word embeddings include sets that were trained on billions of tokens, some up to 840 billion tokens. These algorithms exhibit stereotypical biases, such as gender bias which can be traced back to the original training data. For example certain occupations seem to be more biased towards a particular gender, reinforcing problematic stereotypes. The nearest solution to this problem are some de-biasing algorithms as the one presented in https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1184/reports/6835575.pdf which one can use on embeddings of their choice to mitigate bias, if present.

# ## 3. Build the Deep Learning Model¶
#  It is time to start implementing our LSTM! You will have to first familiarize yourself with some high-level concepts of the basic building blocks of a deep learning model. You can refer to the [Deep learning on MNIST from scratch tutorial](https://numpy.org/numpy-tutorials/content/tutorial-deep-learning-on-mnist.html) for the same.
#
# You will then learn how a Recurrent Neural Network differs from a plain Neural Network and what makes it so suitable for processing sequential data. Afterwards, you will construct the building blocks of a simple deep learning model in Python and NumPy and train it to learn to classify the sentiment of a piece of text as positive or negative with a certain level of accuracy
#
# ### Introduction to a Long Short Term Memory Network
#
# In a [Multilayer perceptron](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multilayer_perceptron) (MLP), the information only moves in one direction — from the input layer, through the hidden layers, to the output layer. The information moves straight through the network and never takes the previous nodes into account at a later stage. Because it only considers the current input, the features learned are not shared across different positions of the sequence. Moreover, it cannot process sequences with varying lengths.
#
# Unlike an MLP, the RNN was designed to work with sequence prediction problems.RNNs introduce state variables to store past information, together with the current inputs, to determine the current outputs. Since an RNN shares the learned features with all the data points in a sequence regardless of its length, it is capable of processing sequences with varying lengths.
#
# The problem with an RNN however, is that it cannot retain long-term memory because the influence of a given input on the hidden layer, and therefore on the network output, either decays or blows up exponentially as it cycles around the network’s recurrent connections. This shortcoming is referred to as the vanishing gradient problem. Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) is an RNN architecture specifically designed to address the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem).

# ### Overview of the Model Architecture
#
# ![Overview of the model architecture, showing a series of animated boxes. There are five identical boxes labeled A and receiving as input one of the words in the phrase "life's a box of chocolates". Each box is highlighted in turn, representing the memory blocks of the LSTM network as information passes through them, ultimately reaching a "Positive" output value.](_static/lstm.gif)
#
# In the above gif, the rectangles labeled $A$ are called `Cells` and they are the **Memory Blocks** of our LSTM network. They are responsible for choosing what to remember in a sequence and pass on that information to the next cell via two states called the `hidden state` $H_{t}$ and the `cell state` $C_{t}$ where $t$ indicates the time-step. Each `Cell` has dedicated gates which are responsible for storing, writing or reading the information passed to an LSTM. You will now look closely at the architecture of the network by implementing each mechanism happening inside of it.

# Lets start with writing a function to randomly initialize the parameters which will be learned while our model trains


def initialise_params(hidden_dim, input_dim):
    # forget gate
    Wf = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, hidden_dim + input_dim)
    bf = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, 1)
    # input gate
    Wi = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, hidden_dim + input_dim)
    bi = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, 1)
    # candidate memory gate
    Wcm = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, hidden_dim + input_dim)
    bcm = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, 1)
    # output gate
    Wo = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, hidden_dim + input_dim)
    bo = np.random.randn(hidden_dim, 1)

    # fully connected layer for classification
    W2 = np.random.randn(1, hidden_dim)
    b2 = np.zeros((1, 1))

    parameters = {
        "Wf": Wf,
        "bf": bf,
        "Wi": Wi,
        "bi": bi,
        "Wcm": Wcm,
        "bcm": bcm,
        "Wo": Wo,
        "bo": bo,
        "W2": W2,
        "b2": b2,
    }
    return parameters


# ### Forward Propagation
#
# Now that you have your initialized parameters, you can pass the input data in a forward direction through the network. Each layer accepts the input data, processes it and passes it to the successive layer. This process is called `Forward Propagation`. You will undertake the following mechanism to implement it:
# - Loading the word embeddings of the input data
# - Passing the embeddings to an LSTM
# - Perform all the gate mechanisms in every memory block of the LSTM to obtain the final hidden state
# - Passing the final hidden state through a fully connected layer to obtain the probability with which the sequence is positive
# - Storing all the calculated values in a cache to utilize during backpropagation

# [Sigmoid](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp.html?highlight=sigmoid#sigmoid-function) belongs to the family of non-linear activation functions. It helps the network to update or forget the data. If the sigmoid of a value results in 0, the information is considered forgotten. Similarly, the information stays if it is 1.


def sigmoid(x):
    n = np.exp(np.fmin(x, 0))
    d = 1 + np.exp(-np.abs(x))
    return n / d


# The **Forget Gate** takes the current word embedding and the previous hidden state concatenated together as input. and decides what parts of the old memory cell content need attention and which can be ignored.


def fp_forget_gate(concat, parameters):
    ft = sigmoid(np.dot(parameters["Wf"], concat) + parameters["bf"])
    return ft


# The **Input Gate** takes the current word embedding and the previous hidden state concatenated together as input. and governs how much of the new data we take into account via the **Candidate Memory Gate** which utilizes the [Tanh](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/mlp.html?highlight=tanh#tanh-function) to regulate the values flowing through the network.


def fp_input_gate(concat, parameters):
    it = sigmoid(np.dot(parameters["Wi"], concat) + parameters["bi"])
    cmt = np.tanh(np.dot(parameters["Wcm"], concat) + parameters["bcm"])
    return it, cmt


# Finally we have the **Output Gate** which takes information from the current word embedding, previous hidden state and the cell state which has been updated with information from the forget and input gates to update the value of the hidden state.


def fp_output_gate(concat, next_cs, parameters):
    ot = sigmoid(np.dot(parameters["Wo"], concat) + parameters["bo"])
    next_hs = ot * np.tanh(next_cs)
    return ot, next_hs


# The following image summarizes each gate mechanism in the memory block of a LSTM network:
# >Image has been modified from [this](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-030-14524-8_11) source
#
# ![Diagram showing three sections of a memory block, labeled "Forget gate", "Input gate" and "Output gate". Each gate contains several subparts, representing the operations performed at that stage of the process.](_static/mem_block.png)
#
# ### But how do you obtain sentiment from the LSTM's output?
#
# The hidden state you obtain from the output gate of the last memory block in a sequence is considered to be a representation of all the information contained in a sequence. To classify this information into various classes (2 in our case, positive and negative) we use a **Fully Connected layer** which firstly maps this information to a predefined output size (1 in our case). Then, an activation function such as the sigmoid converts this output to a value between 0 and 1. We'll consider values greater than 0.5 to be indicative of a positive sentiment.


def fp_fc_layer(last_hs, parameters):
    z2 = np.dot(parameters["W2"], last_hs) + parameters["b2"]
    a2 = sigmoid(z2)
    return a2


# Now you will put all these functions together to summarize the **Forward Propagation** step in our model architecture:


def forward_prop(X_vec, parameters, input_dim):

    hidden_dim = parameters["Wf"].shape[0]
    time_steps = len(X_vec)

    # Initialise hidden and cell state before passing to first time step
    prev_hs = np.zeros((hidden_dim, 1))
    prev_cs = np.zeros(prev_hs.shape)

    # Store all the intermediate and final values here
    caches = {"lstm_values": [], "fc_values": []}

    # Hidden state from the last cell in the LSTM layer is calculated.
    for t in range(time_steps):
        # Retrieve word corresponding to current time step
        x = X_vec[t]
        # Retrieve the embedding for the word and reshape it to make the LSTM happy
        xt = emb_matrix.get(x, np.random.rand(input_dim, 1))
        xt = xt.reshape((input_dim, 1))

        # Input to the gates is concatenated previous hidden state and current word embedding
        concat = np.vstack((prev_hs, xt))

        # Calculate output of the forget gate
        ft = fp_forget_gate(concat, parameters)

        # Calculate output of the input gate
        it, cmt = fp_input_gate(concat, parameters)
        io = it * cmt

        # Update the cell state
        next_cs = (ft * prev_cs) + io

        # Calculate output of the output gate
        ot, next_hs = fp_output_gate(concat, next_cs, parameters)

        # store all the values used and calculated by
        # the LSTM in a cache for backward propagation.
        lstm_cache = {
            "next_hs": next_hs,
            "next_cs": next_cs,
            "prev_hs": prev_hs,
            "prev_cs": prev_cs,
            "ft": ft,
            "it": it,
            "cmt": cmt,
            "ot": ot,
            "xt": xt,
        }
        caches["lstm_values"].append(lstm_cache)

        # Pass the updated hidden state and cell state to the next time step
        prev_hs = next_hs
        prev_cs = next_cs

    # Pass the LSTM output through a fully connected layer to
    # obtain probability of the sequence being positive
    a2 = fp_fc_layer(next_hs, parameters)

    # store all the values used and calculated by the
    # fully connected layer in a cache for backward propagation.
    fc_cache = {"a2": a2, "W2": parameters["W2"]}
    caches["fc_values"].append(fc_cache)
    return caches


# ### Backpropagation
#
# After each forward pass through the network, you will implement the `backpropagation through time` algorithm to accumulate gradients of each parameter over the time steps. Backpropagation through a LSTM is not as straightforward as through other common Deep Learning architectures, due to the special way its underlying layers interact. Nonetheless, the approach is largely the same; identifying dependencies and applying the chain rule.

# Lets start with defining a function to initialize gradients of each parameter as arrays made up of zeros with same dimensions as the corresponding parameter

# Initialise the gradients
def initialize_grads(parameters):
    grads = {}
    for param in parameters.keys():
        grads[f"d{param}"] = np.zeros((parameters[param].shape))
    return grads


# Now, for each gate and the fully connected layer, we define a function to calculate the gradient of the loss with respect to the input passed and the parameters used. To understand the mathematics behind how the derivatives were calculated we suggest you to follow this helpful [blog](https://christinakouridi.blog/2019/06/19/backpropagation-lstm/) by Christina Kouridi.

# ### Updating the Parameters
#
# We update the parameters through an optimization algorithm called [Adam](https://optimization.cbe.cornell.edu/index.php?title=Adam) which is an extension to stochastic gradient descent that has recently seen broader adoption for deep learning applications in computer vision and natural language processing. Specifically, the algorithm calculates an exponential moving average of the gradient and the squared gradient, and the parameters `beta1` and `beta2` control the decay rates of these moving averages. Adam has shown increased convergence and robustness over other gradient descent algorithms and is often recommended as the default optimizer for training.

# Define a function to initialise the moving averages for each parameter

# initialise the moving averages

# In the plot above, you're shown what percentages of each speech are expected to carry a positive and negative  sentiment. Since this implementation prioritized simplicity and clarity over performance, we cannot expect these results to be very accurate. Moreover, while making the sentiment predictions for one paragraph we did not use the neighboring paragraphs for context which would have led to more accurate predictions. We encourage the reader to play around with the model and make some tweaks suggested in `Next Steps` and observe how the model performance changes.

# ## Looking at our Neural Network from an ethical perspective

# It's crucial to understand that accurately identifying a text's sentiment is not easy primarily because of the complex ways in which humans express sentiment, using irony, sarcasm, humor, or, in social media, abbreviation. Moreover neatly placing text into two categories: 'positive' and 'negative' can be problematic because it is being done without any context. Words or abbreviations can convey very different sentiments depending on age and location, none of which we took into account while building our model.
#
# Along with data, there are also growing concerns that data processing algorithms are influencing policy and daily lives in ways that are not transparent and introduce biases. Certain biases such as the [Inductive Bias](https://bit.ly/2WtTKIe) are essential to help a Machine Learning model generalize better, for example the LSTM we built earlier is biased towards preserving contextual information over long sequences which makes it so suitable for processing sequential data. The problem arises when [societal biases](https://hbr.org/2019/10/what-do-we-do-about-the-biases-in-ai) creep into algorithmic predictions. Optimizing Machine algorithms via methods like [hyperparameter tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperparameter_optimization) can then further amplify these biases by learning every bit of information in the data.
#
#
# There are also cases where bias is only in the output and not the inputs (data, algorithm). For example, in sentiment analysis [accuracy tends to be higher on female-authored texts than on male-authored ones]( https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics9020374). End users of sentiment analysis should be aware that its small gender biases can affect the conclusions drawn from it and apply correction factors when necessary. Hence, it is important that demands for algorithmic accountability should include the ability to test the outputs of a system, including the ability to drill down into different user groups by gender, ethnicity and other characteristics, to identify, and hopefully suggest corrections for, system output biases.

# ## Next Steps

# You have learned how to build and train a simple Long Short Term Memory network from scratch using just NumPy to perform sentiment analysis.
#
# To further enhance and optimize your neural network model, you can consider one of a mixture of the following:
#
# - Alter the architecture by introducing multiple LSTM layers to make the network deeper.
# - Use a higher epoch size to train longer and add more regularization techniques, such as early stopping, to prevent overfitting.
# - Introduce a validation set for an unbiased evaluation of the model fit.
# - Apply batch normalization for faster and more stable training.
# - Tune other parameters, such as the learning rate and hidden layer size.
# - Initialize weights using [Xavier Initialization](https://d2l.ai/chapter_multilayer-perceptrons/numerical-stability-and-init.html#xavier-initialization) to prevent vanishing/exploding gradients instead of initializing them randomly.
# - Replace LSTM with a [Bidirectional LSTM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bidirectional_recurrent_neural_networks) to use both left and right context for predicting sentiment.
#
# Nowadays, LSTMs have been replaced by the [Transformer](https://jalammar.github.io/illustrated-transformer/)( which uses [Attention](https://jalammar.github.io/visualizing-neural-machine-translation-mechanics-of-seq2seq-models-with-attention/) to tackle all the problems that plague an LSTM such as as lack of [transfer learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transfer_learning), lack of [parallel training](https://web.stanford.edu/~rezab/classes/cme323/S16/projects_reports/hedge_usmani.pdf) and a long gradient chain for lengthy sequences
#
# Building a neural network from scratch with NumPy is a great way to learn more about NumPy and about deep learning. However, for real-world applications you should use specialized frameworks — such as PyTorch, JAX, TensorFlow or MXNet — that provide NumPy-like APIs, have built-in automatic differentiation and GPU support, and are designed for high-performance numerical computing and machine learning.
