# # X-ray image processing

# This tutorial demonstrates how to read and process X-ray images with NumPy,
# imageio, Matplotlib and SciPy. You will learn how to load medical images, focus
# on certain parts, and visually compare them using the
# [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter),
# [Laplacian-Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution),
# [Sobel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator), and
# [Canny](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector) filters for edge
# detection.
#
# X-ray image analysis can be part of your data analysis and
# [machine learning workflow](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S235291481930214X)
# when, for example, you're building an algorithm that helps
# [detect pneumonia](https://www.kaggle.com/c/rsna-pneumonia-detection-challenge)
# as part of a [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com)
# [competition](https://www.kaggle.com/eduardomineo/u-net-lung-segmentation-montgomery-shenzhen).
# In the healthcare industry, medical image processing and analysis is
# particularly important when images are estimated to account for
# [at least 90%](https://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/51146.wss) of all
# medical data.
#
# You'll be working with radiology images from the
# [ChestX-ray8](https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-clinical-center-provides-one-largest-publicly-available-chest-x-ray-datasets-scientific-community)
# dataset provided by the [National Institutes of Health (NIH)](http://nih.gov).
# ChestX-ray8 contains over 100,000 de-identified X-ray images in the PNG format
# from more than 30,000 patients. You can find ChestX-ray8's files on NIH's public
# Box [repository](https://nihcc.app.box.com/v/ChestXray-NIHCC) in the `/images`
# folder. (For more details, refer to the research
# [paper](http://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2017/papers/Wang_ChestX-ray8_Hospital-Scale_Chest_CVPR_2017_paper.pdf)
# published at CVPR (a computer vision conference) in 2017.)
#
# For your convenience, a small number of PNG images have been saved to this
# tutorial's repository under `tutorial-x-ray-image-processing/`, since
# ChestX-ray8 contains gigabytes of data and you may find it challenging to
# download it in batches.

# ## Prerequisites

# The reader should have some knowledge of Python, NumPy arrays, and Matplotlib.
# To refresh the memory, you can take the
# [Python](https://docs.python.org/dev/tutorial/index.html) and Matplotlib
# [PyPlot](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/pyplot.html) tutorials,
# and the NumPy [quickstart](https://numpy.org/devdocs/user/quickstart.html).
#
# The following packages are used in this tutorial:
#
# - [imageio](https://imageio.github.io) for reading and writing image data. The
# healthcare industry usually works with the
# [DICOM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DICOM) format for medical imaging and
# [imageio](https://imageio.readthedocs.io/en/stable/format_dicom.html) should be
# well-suited for reading that format. For simplicity, in this tutorial you'll be
# working with PNG files.
# - [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) for data visualization.
# - [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org) for multi-dimensional image processing via
# [`ndimage`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/ndimage.html).
#
# This tutorial can be run locally in an isolated environment, such as
# [Virtualenv](https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/) or
# [conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html).
# You can use [Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab](https://jupyter.org/install) to run
# each notebook cell.

# ---

# ## Examine an X-ray with `imageio`

# Let's begin with a simple example using just one X-ray image from the
# ChestX-ray8 dataset.
#
# The file — `00000011_001.png` — has been downloaded for you and saved in the
# `/tutorial-x-ray-image-processing` folder.

# **1.** Load the image with `imageio`:

# +
import os
import imageio

DIR = "tutorial-x-ray-image-processing"

xray_image = imageio.imread(os.path.join(DIR, "00000011_001.png"))
# -

# **2.** Check that its shape is 1024x1024 pixels and that the array is made up of
# 8-bit integers:

print(xray_image.shape)
print(xray_image.dtype)

# **3.** Import `matplotlib` and display the image in a grayscale colormap:

# +
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.imshow(xray_image, cmap="gray")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ## Combine images into a multidimensional array to demonstrate progression

# In the next example, instead of 1 image you'll use 9 X-ray 1024x1024-pixel
# images from the ChestX-ray8 dataset that have been downloaded and extracted
# from one of the dataset files. They are numbered from `...000.png` to
# `...008.png` and let's assume they belong to the same patient.
#
# **1.** Import NumPy, read in each of the X-rays, and create a three-dimensional
# array where the first dimension corresponds to image number:

# +
import numpy as np

num_imgs = 9

combined_xray_images_1 = np.array(
    [
        imageio.imread(os.path.join(DIR, f"00000011_00{i}.png"))
        for i in range(num_imgs)
    ]
)
# -

# **2.** Check the shape of the new X-ray image array containing 9 stacked images:

combined_xray_images_1.shape

# Note that the shape in the first dimension matches `num_imgs`, so the
# `combined_xray_images_1` array can be interpreted as a stack of 2D images.
#
# **3.** You can now display the "health progress" by plotting each of frames next
# to each other using Matplotlib:

# +
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=num_imgs, figsize=(30, 30))

for img, ax in zip(combined_xray_images_1, axes):
    ax.imshow(img, cmap="gray")
    ax.axis("off")
# -

# **4.** In addition, it can be helpful to show the progress as an animation.
# Let's create a GIF file with `imageio.mimwrite()` and display the result in the
# notebook:

GIF_PATH = os.path.join(DIR, "xray_image.gif")
imageio.mimwrite(GIF_PATH, combined_xray_images_1, format=".gif", fps=1)

# Which gives us:
# ![An animated gif repeatedly cycles through a series of 8 x-rays, showing the same viewpoint of the patient's chest at different points in time. The patient's bones and internal organs can be visually compared from frame to frame.](tutorial-x-ray-image-processing/xray_image.gif)
# ## Edge detection using the Laplacian-Gaussian, Gaussian gradient, Sobel, and Canny filters

# When processing biomedical data, it can be useful to emphasize the 2D
# ["edges"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_detection) to focus on particular
# features in an image. To do that, using
# [image gradients](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_gradient) can be
# particularly helpful when detecting the change of color pixel intensity.

# ### The Laplace filter with Gaussian second derivatives
#
# Let's start with an n-dimensional
# [Laplace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_distribution) filter
# ("Laplacian-Gaussian") that uses
# [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) second
# derivatives. This Laplacian method focuses on pixels with rapid intensity change
# in values and is combined with Gaussian smoothing to
# [remove noise](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/rbf/HIPR2/log.htm). Let's examine
# how it can be useful in analyzing 2D X-ray images.

# - The implementation of the Laplacian-Gaussian filter is relatively
# straightforward: 1) import the `ndimage` module from SciPy; and 2) call
# [`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_laplace()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.gaussian_laplace.html)
# with a sigma (scalar) parameter, which affects the standard deviations of the
# Gaussian filter (you'll use `1` in the example below):

# +
from scipy import ndimage

xray_image_laplace_gaussian = ndimage.gaussian_laplace(xray_image, sigma=1)
# -

# Display the original X-ray and the one with the Laplacian-Gaussian filter:

# +
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 10))

axes[0].set_title("Original")
axes[0].imshow(xray_image, cmap="gray")
axes[1].set_title("Laplacian-Gaussian (edges)")
axes[1].imshow(xray_image_laplace_gaussian, cmap="gray")
for i in axes:
    i.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ### The Gaussian gradient magnitude method
#
# Another method for edge detection that can be useful is the
# [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution) (gradient) filter.
# It computes the multidimensional gradient magnitude with Gaussian derivatives
# and helps by remove
# [high-frequency](https://www.cs.cornell.edu/courses/cs6670/2011sp/lectures/lec02_filter.pdf)
# image components.

# **1.** Call [`scipy.ndimage.gaussian_gradient_magnitude()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.gaussian_gradient_magnitude.html)
# with a sigma (scalar) parameter (for standard deviations; you'll use `2` in the
# example below):

x_ray_image_gaussian_gradient = ndimage.gaussian_gradient_magnitude(
    xray_image, sigma=2
)

# **2.** Display the original X-ray and the one with the Gaussian gradient filter:

# +
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=2, figsize=(10, 10))

axes[0].set_title("Original")
axes[0].imshow(xray_image, cmap="gray")
axes[1].set_title("Gaussian gradient (edges)")
axes[1].imshow(x_ray_image_gaussian_gradient, cmap="gray")
for i in axes:
    i.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ### The Sobel-Feldman operator (the Sobel filter)
#
# To find regions of high spatial frequency (the edges or the edge maps) along the
# horizontal and vertical axes of a 2D X-ray image, you can use the
# [Sobel-Feldman operator (Sobel filter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sobel_operator)
# technique. The Sobel filter applies two 3x3 kernel matrices — one for each axis
# — onto the X-ray through a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Convolution).
# Then, these two points (gradients) are combined using the
# [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) to
# produce a gradient magnitude.

# **1.** Use the Sobel filters — ([`scipy.ndimage.sobel()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.sobel.html))
# — on x- and y-axes of the X-ray. Then, calculate the distance between `x` and
# `y` (with the Sobel filters applied to them) using the
# [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) and
# NumPy's [`np.hypot()`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.hypot.html)
# to obtain the magnitude. Finally, normalize the rescaled image for the pixel
# values to be between 0 and 255.
#
# [Image normalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28image_processing%29)
# follows the `output_channel = 255.0 * (input_channel - min_value) / (max_value - min_value)`
# [formula](http://dev.ipol.im/~nmonzon/Normalization.pdf). Because you're
# using a grayscale image, you need to normalize just one channel.

# +
x_sobel = ndimage.sobel(xray_image, axis=0)
y_sobel = ndimage.sobel(xray_image, axis=1)

xray_image_sobel = np.hypot(x_sobel, y_sobel)

xray_image_sobel *= 255.0 / np.max(xray_image_sobel)
# -

# **2.** Change the new image array data type to the 32-bit floating-point format
# from `float16` to [make it compatible](https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/15432)
# with Matplotlib:

# +
print("The data type - before: ", xray_image_sobel.dtype)

xray_image_sobel = xray_image_sobel.astype("float32")

print("The data type - after: ", xray_image_sobel.dtype)
# -

# **3.** Display the original X-ray and the one with the Sobel "edge" filter
# applied. Note that both the grayscale and `CMRmap` colormaps are used to help
# emphasize the edges:

# +
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=3, figsize=(15, 15))

axes[0].set_title("Original")
axes[0].imshow(xray_image, cmap="gray")
axes[1].set_title("Sobel (edges) - grayscale")
axes[1].imshow(xray_image_sobel, cmap="gray")
axes[2].set_title("Sobel (edges) - CMRmap")
axes[2].imshow(xray_image_sobel, cmap="CMRmap")
for i in axes:
    i.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ### The Canny filter
#
# You can also consider using another well-known filter for edge detection called
# the [Canny filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canny_edge_detector).
#
# First, you apply a [Gaussian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_filter)
# filter to remove the noise in an image. In this example, you're using using the
# [Fourier](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform) filter which
# smoothens the X-ray through a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution)
# process. Next, you apply the [Prewitt filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prewitt_operator)
# on each of the 2 axes of the image to help detect some of the edges — this will
# result in 2 gradient values. Similar to the Sobel filter, the Prewitt operator
# also applies two 3x3 kernel matrices — one for each axis — onto the X-ray
# through a [convolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_(image_processing)#Convolution).
# In the end, you compute the magnitude between the two gradients using the
# [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) and
# [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28image_processing%29)
# the images, as before.

# **1.** Use SciPy's Fourier filters — [`scipy.ndimage.fourier_gaussian()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.fourier_gaussian.html)
# — with a small `sigma` value to remove some of the noise from the X-ray. Then,
# calculate two gradients using [`scipy.ndimage.prewitt()`](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.ndimage.prewitt.html).
# Next, measure the distance between the gradients using NumPy's `np.hypot()`.
# Finally, [normalize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normalization_%28image_processing%29)
# the rescaled image, as before.

# +
fourier_gaussian = ndimage.fourier_gaussian(xray_image, sigma=0.05)

x_prewitt = ndimage.prewitt(fourier_gaussian, axis=0)
y_prewitt = ndimage.prewitt(fourier_gaussian, axis=1)

xray_image_canny = np.hypot(x_prewitt, y_prewitt)

xray_image_canny *= 255.0 / np.max(xray_image_canny)

print("The data type - ", xray_image_canny.dtype)
# -

# **2.** Plot the original X-ray image and the ones with the edges detected with
# the help of the Canny filter technique. The edges can be emphasized using the
# `prism`, `nipy_spectral`, and `terrain` Matplotlib colormaps.

# +
fig, axes = plt.subplots(nrows=1, ncols=4, figsize=(20, 15))

axes[0].set_title("Original")
axes[0].imshow(xray_image, cmap="gray")
axes[1].set_title("Canny (edges) - prism")
axes[1].imshow(xray_image_canny, cmap="prism")
axes[2].set_title("Canny (edges) - nipy_spectral")
axes[2].imshow(xray_image_canny, cmap="nipy_spectral")
axes[3].set_title("Canny (edges) - terrain")
axes[3].imshow(xray_image_canny, cmap="terrain")
for i in axes:
    i.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ## Apply masks to X-rays with `np.where()`

# To screen out only certain pixels in X-ray images to help detect particular
# features, you can apply masks with NumPy's
# [`np.where(condition: array_like (bool), x: array_like, y: ndarray)`](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/reference/generated/numpy.where.html)
# that returns `x` when `True` and `y` when `False`.
#
# Identifying regions of interest — certain sets of pixels in an image — can be
# useful and masks serve as boolean arrays of the same shape as the original
# image.

# **1.** Retrieve some basics statistics about the pixel values in the original
# X-ray image you've been working with:

print("The data type of the X-ray image is: ", xray_image.dtype)
print("The minimum pixel value is: ", np.min(xray_image))
print("The maximum pixel value is: ", np.max(xray_image))
print("The average pixel value is: ", np.mean(xray_image))
print("The median pixel value is: ", np.median(xray_image))

# **2.** The array data type is `uint8` and the minimum/maximum value results
# suggest that all 256 colors (from `0` to `255`) are used in the X-ray. Let's
# visualize the _pixel intensity distribution_ of the original raw X-ray image
# with `ndimage.histogram()` and Matplotlib:

# +
pixel_intensity_distribution = ndimage.histogram(
    xray_image, min=np.min(xray_image), max=np.max(xray_image), bins=256
)

plt.plot(pixel_intensity_distribution)
plt.title("Pixel intensity distribution")
plt.show()
# -

# As the pixel intensity distribution suggests, there are many low (between around
# 0 and 20) and very high (between around 200 and 240) pixel values.
#
# **3.** You can create different conditional masks with NumPy's `np.where()` —
# for example, let's have only those values of the image with the pixels exceeding
# a certain threshold:

# +
# The threshold is "greater than 150"
# Return the original image if true, `0` otherwise
xray_image_mask_noisy = np.where(xray_image > 150, xray_image, 0)

plt.imshow(xray_image_mask_noisy, cmap="gray")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()

# +
# The threshold is "greater than 150"
# Return `1` if true, `0` otherwise
xray_image_mask_less_noisy = np.where(xray_image > 150, 1, 0)

plt.imshow(xray_image_mask_less_noisy, cmap="gray")
plt.axis("off")
plt.show()
# -

# ## Compare the results

# Let's display some of the results of processed X-ray images you've worked with
