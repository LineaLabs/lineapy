def save(reference: object, name: str) -> LineaArtifact:
    """
    Publishes the object to the Linea DB.

    Parameters
    ----------
    reference: Union[object, ExternalState]
        The reference could be a variable name, in which case Linea will save
        the value of the variable, with out default serialization mechanism.
        Alternatively, it could be a "side effect" reference, which currently includes either :class:`lineapy.file_system` or :class:`lineapy.db`.
        Linea will save the associated process that creates the final side effects.
        We are in the process of adding more side effect references, including `assert` statements.
    name: str
        The name is used for later retrieving the artifact and creating new versions if an artifact of the name has been created before.

    Returns
    -------
    LineaArtifact
        returned value offers methods to access
        information we have stored about the artifact (value, version), and other automation capabilities, such as :func:`to_airflow`.

      - it will allow us to use any serializer to create binaries - could be a better pickler, another completely diff method.

      - We'll have to handle the reads manually as well and all that change is beyond the scope of this PR.
