    Graph represents for task dependency
    It is constructed based on the "edges" variable

    :param edges: Dictionary with task name as key and set of prerequisite 
        tasks as value. This is the standard library `graphlib` style graph 
        definition. For instance, {'C':{'A','B'}} means A and B are 
        prerequisites for C. Both examples give us following task dependency::

            A ---\\
                  \\
                   >---> C

    .. note::
        - If we only support Python 3.9+, we prefer to use graphlib in standard 
          library instead of networkx for graph operation.

        - We might want to get rid of the mapping for renaming slice_names to 
          task_names.
