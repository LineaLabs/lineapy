    """
    Translates a list of object side effects to a list of side effects, by
    mapping objects to nodes, and only emitting side effects
    that references only input nodes or the output globals.

    The process is not just trimming off internal variables, but also sometimes
    transitively searching for nodes. Consider the following example:

    ```python
    y = 10
    if ...:
        z = [y]
        a = [z]
        del z
    ```

    We want to establish that `a` is a view of `y`, and skip z because it's not in
    the outer scope that we care about.

    object_side_effects: Iterable[ObjectSideEffect]

    output_globals: Mapping[str, object]
        Mapping of global identifier to the value of all globals that were set during this execution.
