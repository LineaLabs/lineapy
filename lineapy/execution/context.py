"""
This module contains a number of globals, which are set by the execution when 
it is processing call nodes.

They are used as a side channel to pass values from the executor to special functions
which need to know more about the execution context, like in the `exec` to know
the source code of the current node.

This module exposes three global functions, which are meant to be used like:

1. The `executor` calls `set_context` before executing every call node.
2. The function being called can call `get_context` to get the current context.
3. The `executor` calls `teardown_context` after its finished executing

I.e. the context is created for every call.

Use the same globals for all executions, so that a function created during
