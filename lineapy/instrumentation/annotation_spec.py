NOTE:
- All the classes in the `ValuePointer` follow this weird structure where
  their field entries duplicate the class name---this is so that when we load
  the YAMLs, they can differentiate the class based just by the field names.
  - Also the string values for `AllPositionalArgs`, `BoundSelfOfFunction`, 
    and `Result` are useless as well---just there so that we abide by the
    yaml structure. It's not very elegant and we can refactor this later.

- figure out how to capture the name of the DB
  - where the relevant SQL string is
